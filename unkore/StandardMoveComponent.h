// Why is it derived from CCSprite? Because enemies use a SpriteBatch, and CCSpriteBatchNode requires that all
// child nodes added to it are CCSprite. Under other circumstances I would use a CCNode as parent class of course, since
// the components won't have a texture and everything else that a Sprite has.
